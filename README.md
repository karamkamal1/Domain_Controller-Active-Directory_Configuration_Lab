# Windows Domain Controller Configuration/ Active Directory configuration
This is my experience on configuring a Domain Controller to give a client internet access through the domain controller as well as Configure Active Directory. A step by step guide for the lab will also be included in a link on the page (:

## Objective
The objective of the lab is to configure and manage network infrastructure through a Windows domain controller. The primary goal was to enable client connectivity to the internet via the domain controller, while also implementing Active Directory to enforce user policies within the domain. This setup aimed to simulate a real-world corporate network. 

### Skills Learned

- Understanding of IP addresses and network configuration
- A more advanced understanding of windows server operating system and configuration.
- Enchanced knowledge of dorporate domain setup with active directory


### Tools Used

- VMware to host the server alongside the client computer
- Server Manager
- Server Configuration Tools
- Active Directory Users and Computers configuration
  

## Diagram
This network diagram outlines the setup for our upcoming lab environment. In this scenario, the client computer is configured to route all internet traffic through the internal network, ultimately passing through the domain controller for internet access. This design utilizes a domain controller (DC) that serves dual purposes: managing domain resources and handling network routing with RAS/NAT functionalities.
